### jaCappella Corpus

The jaCappella corpus is a corpus of Japanese a cappella vocal ensembles. It consists of 35 copyright-cleared vocal ensemble songs and their audio recordings of individual voice parts. (Note that the jaCappella corpus team reserves all copyrights and neighboring rights of the vocal ensemble songs.) These songs were arranged from out-of-copyright Japanese childrenâ€™s songs. All songs have six voice parts (lead vocal, soprano, alto, tenor, bass, and vocal percussion). They are divided into seven subsets (jazz, punk rock, bossa nova, popular, reggae, enka, and neutral), each of which features typical characteristics of a music genre.
